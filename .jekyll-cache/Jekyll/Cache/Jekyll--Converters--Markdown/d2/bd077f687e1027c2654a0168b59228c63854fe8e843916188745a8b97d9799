I"¥<p>In 2016, I obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree in advanced infographic technics, specialised in User Experience &amp; Web Design. I started for 1 year as a freelance, then I decided to join a team within the Microsoft Innovation Center of Mons. Then finally within Adneom in order to discover different work ecosystems and new challenges within my missions.
I keep a real love for simple, easy, meaningful experiences.</p>

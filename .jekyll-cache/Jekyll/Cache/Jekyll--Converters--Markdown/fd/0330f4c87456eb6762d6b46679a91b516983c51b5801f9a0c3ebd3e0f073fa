I"<p>Context of the project: Sodexo recently gains the call for offer coming from the three different areas of Belgium (Wallonia, Flanders, Brussels) to be the only service provider of the service vouchers. 
They already gained it several years before that’s why they already had platforms and apps which provided the service needed from the regions. The main goal was to, based on what they had, completely rethink and redo the platforms and mobile apps with a strong UX focus and accordingly with a lot of constraints from the 3 different specifications (for each region).
My mission consisted in understanding the current platforms and apps, its features and the whole life cycle of the services vouchers from each side: the citizens, the providers, the workers and Sodexo. Then, to be able to help them to propose new platforms and apps with a lot of improvements compared to the previous ones. The challenge was to deliver 2 platforms and 2 apps in less than 6 months.</p>

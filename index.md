In 2016, I obtained a bachelor’s degree in advanced infographic technics, specialised in User Experience & Web Design. I started for 1 year as a freelance, then I decided to join a team within the Microsoft Innovation Center of Mons. Then finally within Adneom in order to discover different work ecosystems and new challenges within my missions.
I keep a real love for simple, easy, meaningful experiences.
